I am a doctoral candidate in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://hsph.harvard.edu). Under the guidance of [Caroline Buckee](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/caroline-buckee/), I use mathematical models and big data to design intervention strategies for control of epidemic-prone diseases including cholera and Ebola. I hold degrees in biomedical engineering, religious studies, and epidemiologic methods from Vanderbilt and Harvard.

Starting July 2017, I will begin the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) fellowship.
